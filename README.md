# Flutter UI Challenge

The Flutter UI challenge is a contest that inspires and encourages you to build beautiful Flutter applications. It focuses on UI, because we want to show that most UIs and animations can be built with Flutter.

# Who can participate

Anyone can join this challenge, from any skill level. All you need is enthusiasm ðŸ˜„

# How

1. The challenge's theme will be announced during every meetup (occurs monthly) in Flutter Jakarta [Telegram](https://t.me/flutter_jkt) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flutter_jkt).
2. Register and submit the challenge by commenting in [github issues](https://github.com/flutter-jakarta/flutter-ui-challenge/issues).
3. The challenges are intentionally high-level. We will provide the thematic challenge and participants can choose any UI that they'd like to tackle. You can create your own design if you'd prefer, but feel free to imitate real world apps with beautiful UI (but limit the scope to what's possible within the time constraint!) or get inspiration from designer communities such as Dribbble, Behance, etc.
4. Every participant is encouraged to share their progress on twitter with the hashtag #FlutterJakartaUIChallenge #FlutterJakartaUIChallenge1 (sequence number)
5. The best submitter from Indonesia will receive swag as a reward for their efforts ðŸ¥³
6. The winner will be chosen by the Flutter Jakarta team with these criteria:
   - How complex / beautiful the UI
   - Animations
   - Code quality (clean code).
   - Support multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web)
   - Commits, as this will allow us to understand some of the decisions you made throughout the process
